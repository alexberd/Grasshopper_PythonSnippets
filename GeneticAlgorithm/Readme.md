## Single Objective Genetic Algorithm within a Python Grasshopper Node
**Original code transcript from [Alasdair Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alasdair_Turner)**

This implementation offers a very similar functionality to the [Grasshopper Galapagos](https://grasshopperdocs.com/addons/galapagos.html)

### Minimize the time waiting for the right results
The difference to Galapagos is that you review your population, manipulate any of the features and analyse the results of your optimzation during runtime.

### Usage
Create a python node and copy-paste the [snippet](https://github.com/alexberd/Grasshopper_PythonSnippets/blob/master/GeneticAlgorithm/SingleObjectiveGeneticAlgorithm.py). Rename and connect it to the other nodes similar to the image below
